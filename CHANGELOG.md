Update the top section before tagging a new release.

## 0.12.0 (2026-11-08)

- Initial public release for WoW Forever (Interface 16001 / game version 1.60.1).
- Zone-driven Monet-inspired palette: 33 precisely sampled zones, offline color
  sources prioritized as official map art > wuxianwow trip captures > in-game screenshots.
- LibMonetColor-1.0 derives edge / ambient / highlight / neutral tones at runtime,
  with smooth transitions between zones and parent-map inheritance fallback.
- Modular frames and skins: unit, group and boss frames, self-drawn action bars,
  bags, nameplates, minimap, cooldowns, quest tracker, info bar, tooltips,
  window skins and more.
- Every module can be toggled independently and fully reverts to the Blizzard default.
- No hard dependencies (LibStub embedded); `/mui` slash commands; MIT licensed.
